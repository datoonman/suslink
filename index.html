            <h3>What is phishing?</h3>
            <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.</p>
            <h3>How dangerous can it be?</h3>
            <p>Phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and other severe consequences. Always verify the source of unexpected messages and never click on suspicious links.</p>
